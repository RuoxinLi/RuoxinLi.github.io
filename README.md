<p> Hello! My name is Ruoxin Li, you can also call me Rita. I am a first year Ph.D student in Biostatistics at UC Davis. My current research focus is developing statistical methods to visualize single cell expression profiles, in order to better identify cellular trajectories. I am interested in the application of probabilistic models and machine learning methods in high-dimensional genomic data, especially in how model interpretation brings up meaningful biological insights. My work is under the supervision of <a href = "http://qlab.faculty.ucdavis.edu/"> Prof.Gerald Quon</a>,we have a very <a img src="qlab.png">cute lab</a>.</p>

<p>In my spare time, I enjoy hiking ,hand-crafting and understanding the world. I am also trying to develop certain level of expertise in illustration.</p>
